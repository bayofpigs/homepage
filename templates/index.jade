     Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Secular Humanist from Princeton Junction, New Jersey who's into books,
     math, self-improvement and people. I'm also an occasional writer,
     a crappy sketch artist, a 
     <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/d5594dd797de002d9d4d2a57e4c5cd6d">MOOC addict</a> 
     and a computer science student at Princeton.


  p. 
    As a programmer, I dig Unix-like systems, programming languages, machine learning, 
    and web stuff from front to back. I'm quite fluent in JavaScript, C, Java and Python. I'm also 
    an occasional speaker of Scheme, Go, and Ruby.
